                        <p>
                            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or machine to perform tasks that
                            usually
                            require human intelligence. This includes understanding language, recognizing images, making
                            decisions,
                            and learning from experience.

                        <p>
                            AI systems use algorithms and data. Algorithms are step-by-step instructions, and data is
                            the
                            information the system learns from. The more high-quality data it has, the better it can
                            learn.
