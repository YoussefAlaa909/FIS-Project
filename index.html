            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h2>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or machine to perform tasks that usually
                require human intelligence. This includes understanding language, recognizing images, making decisions,
                and learning from experience.

                This website explores how AI works, where it is used in real life, its advantages and risks, and what
                the future of AI might look like.

            <h3>How AI Works</h3>
            <p>
                AI systems use algorithms and data. Algorithms are step-by-step instructions, and data is the
                information the system learns from. The more high-quality data it has, the better it can learn.

            <h3>Types of AI</h3>
            <p>
                There are different types of AI, such as rule-based systems, machine learning, and deep learning.
                Machine learning allows computers to improve automatically through experience.

            <h3>Why AI Matters</h3>
            <p>
                AI can help solve complex problems, save time, and make our lives easier. At the same time, we must
                think about how to use AI responsibly and fairly.
